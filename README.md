# Project: Neighborhood Map

This is the final project of the Udacity FEND Nanodegree. The challenge is to build a functional neighborhood map, using Google Map API, plus another API of my choice. For this project I chose to use Flickr API to attach images to the selected locations on the map.
My map is a guide to find a place where you can meet and catch up with friends over coffee, or grab delicious finds a some amazing brunch spots in Los Angeles. Click on one of the markers on the map for a sneak peak of what to find at these locations.

## Getting Started
